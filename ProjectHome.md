Uninstaller for Windows 7.

This will have the capability to monitor the changes done during any software installation, present the information, and give an option to reverse them.

I created a similar project before, more than 10 years ago, for Windows 98. Surprisingly it still works, though it has started showing initial signs of breaking down.

The old "My Uninstaller" can be downloaded these locations (for now) -

The current project will mostly be a rewrite of the old project. It will aim to achieve better compatibility, speed and functionality enhancements with Windows XP/Vista/7.
